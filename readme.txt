OpenStreetMap Gutenberg block, WPBakery PageBuilder content element and standalone WordPress shortcode

== Description ==

Add beautiful maps to your WordPress pages with ease. Customize location, map styles, up to two markers, routing and more. Include the map as Gutenberg block, WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) content element or shortcode.

== Installation ==

**Notes:**
* the Gutenberg block requires WordPress 5.2 or higher
* the WPBakery Page Builder content element requires an active [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com) plugin

1. Upload the StepByteService OpenStreetMap plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Use one of the components to add maps to your pages.

== General Settings ==

This plugin comes with sane predefined settings. Adjust them to your liking. The marker is optional and is not displayed by default.

= Map Settings =
**Map Style** Choose the style of the map from one of the available map tile providers to fit your needs.
**Map Style Key** Enter an API key or access token for the provider depending on the chosen map style. Only required for some map style providers.
**Map Height in Relation to Width** Change the map's aspect ratio. Works nicely with responsive designs.
**Zoom Level** Change the view distance. The higher the number, the closer the distance to the map. (Note: not all styles support all zoom levels).
**Zoom With CTRL-Key Only** Prevent zooming during page scroll.
**Latitude/Longitude of the Map's Center** Specify the map's center position. Only needed if no marker configured or no marker is set as center of the map.
**Activate Routing** Activate route planning for the user.
**Show Attribution** Display or hide attribution for map styles and data. If you disable the checkbox please consider the legal circumstances.

= Routing Settings =
**Default Routing Destination** Enter the number of the marker that should be the default routing destination.
**Routing Service** Choose the routing service that is used for retrieving the routing information.
**Routing Key** Enter an API key or access token depending on the chosen routing service.

= Geocoding Settings =
**Geocoding Service** Choose the geocoding service that is used to translate addresses to latitude and longitude.
**Geocoding Key** Enter an API key or access token depending on the chosen geocoding service.

= Marker Settings =
**Center map on** Enter the number of the marker that should be in the center of the map.
**Determine Position By** Choose if you want to specify the marker position by an address or coordinates. The marker appears only if you specify an address or coordinates.
**Address** Insert the marker's address here with comma separated address parts (only used if you have chosen 'Address' in previous setting).
**Latitude/Longitude** Specify marker position with latitude and longitude data (only used if you have chosen 'Coordinates' in first setting).
**Icon** The icon to appear on the marker. Subset from [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=outline) in outlined style (available categories: Maps, Places, Social).
**Color** Background color of the marker.
**Popup Text** Content of the popup that appears if the user clicks on the marker.

== Gutenberg ==

The block is located in the 'Embed' category and supports the wide and full width options.

== WPBakery Page Builder ==

The content element for the map can be found on the 'Content' tab with the name 'SBS OpenStreetMap'. The content element for the marker can also be found on the 'Content' tab with the name 'SBS Openstreetmap Marker' but only as child of the map element.

== Shortcodes ==

The Plugin comes with two shortcodes: `[sbs_openstreetmap]` for the map and `[sbs_marker]` for the markers (need to be placed between the opening and closing tags of the map shortcode).
If parameters are not specified, the defaults are used (the same as in the other components). The popup text for the marker can be specified between the opening and closing tags of the marker shortcode.

= Parameters Map Shortcode =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The map does not show properly =

Wikimedia changed its terms of use and is not available as provider anymore. If the chosen map style was wikimedia it is automatically changed to OpenStreetMap.De. You can always choose a different style.

If there are graphical errors, first check if a different zoom level changes anything. Not all map styles support all zoom levels and while most should just show a different zoom level if they don't support the chosen one, there might be parts of the map which are not shown on other styles.
In case the map is placed on a container that is not visible initially (f.e. using tabs or accordions), you'll have to trigger the event `invalidate.sbs.openstreetmap` in JavaScript once the element becomes visible to redraw the map. If you're using Bootstrap or WP Bakery Page Builder tabs or accordions, this is handled by the plugin itself.
